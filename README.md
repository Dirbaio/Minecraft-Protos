#Protos for Minecraft

This is the source code for Protos, the flexible Minecraft map generator. You can combine functions the way you want to make Minecraft worlds of any shape!

Currently it's still in development. For now one has to change the code to change the shape of the map, but I'll add a UI so anyone can make their own maps without writing a single line of code!

This is some examples of what it can do already: http://imgur.com/a/kXiOA
